# Mini Conway's Game of Life 

This is a Terminal version of Game of Life, made in java. 
In its current state, there aren't many features, but it's completely usable for simulating the game of life.

You can choose the size of the field, and every time you start the game, a random start will appear.

Enjoy it! :)
